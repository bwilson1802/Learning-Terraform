In step 1 we setup a resource group.  In this step we will build on it.  

# Step 2 commands (bash terminal)
1.  Ls or dir (look where you are located) Git status displays where you are
2.  Cd to the dir you want to be (is should say main or master)
3.  If it still says your last branch name, git checkout main (or master)
4.  You can open the file explorer and add folders like I have.  If you do that you have to cd to that folder.  You can also keep working out of main.tf but you will write over your code each time.  
5.  git pull (this brings everything to you so you have the most up to date info)
6.  Git checkout -b (new name for this branch)
7.  Copy Step2main.tf to your main.tf (or folder if you created them and cd to it)
8.  Git push --set-upstream origin (your new name) (this is what tells GitHub that you made a new branch) 




   

# Understanding the code

Sample code can be found on the terraform website and they give you examples to follow.  I search Azurerm (then the item.  Terraform website is hard for me to navigate)


provider "azurerm" 
- set your provider
  
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "East_US_RG" 
- Same resource group as step 1
  
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "EastUS-Network" 
- To make a VM we need a network.  I build my networks then VMs

resource "azurerm_subnet" "LOC-A-Subnet" 
- Each network must have a subnet

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "LOC-A-DC1-NIC" 
- The VM will need a NIC to connect to the network

resource "azurerm_windows_virtual_machine" "LOC-A-DC1" 
- Add you VM.  This is a cheap one that I use to practice. 


1.  make your changes in VS Code and save them (ctrl s)
2.  git push
3.  Git add . (adds all changes in that dir)
4.  Git commit -m (“add your message here”)


# tags
1.  Most items can get tags.  You can make them whatever you want. 
2.  Tags can be searched in Azure.  I use Dev so that if I see one I know to delete it at the end of the day.
3.  Here is an example that you can add after the resource you are building.  I will use this more in the next step. 

tags = {
    environment = "dev"
  }

# order of operations
1.  Terraform build in order but sometimes you will get errors.  I have found that the best way to prevent this is to add depends_on.  
2.  I will use this in the next step but here is an example
   
depends_on            = [azurerm_network_interface.LOC-D-DC1-NIC]

# Run Terraform (bash terminal)
1. az login (it will pop out a window for you to log in)
2. terraform init
3. terraform plan
4. terraform apply -auto-approve
5. Log in to Azure and see that you have a resource group, a VM, a nic, and a network
6. terraform destroy -auto-approve
7. terraform state list (make sure nothing is running)
