# Terraform Project

This is my journey to learn Git and Terraform.  I am new to both but wanted to document my journey and have a document that I can reference in the future.  I am on a windows machine for reference.  If you have updates, questions, or I wrote something wrong, please let me know!   

The goal of this project is to use Terraform to install a multi-region network in Azure.
